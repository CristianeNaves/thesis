  abstract = {Requirements engineering (RE) research often ignores or presumes a uniform nature of the context in which the system operates. This assumption is no longer valid in emerging computing paradigms, such as ambient, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, where it is essential to monitor and adapt to an inherently varying context. Besides influencing the software, context may influence stakeholders' goals and their choices to meet them. In this paper, we propose a goal-oriented RE modeling and reasoning framework for systems operating in varying contexts. We introduce contextual goal models to relate goals and contexts; context analysis to refine contexts and identify ways to verify them; reasoning techniques to derive requirements reflecting the context and users priorities at runtime; and finally, design time reasoning techniques to derive requirements for a system to be developed at minimum cost and valid in all considered contexts. We illustrate and evaluate our approach through a case study about a museum-guide mobile information system.},

  abstract = {A system of systems (SoS) integrates independently useful systems into a larger system. Examples are integrated surveillance systems and networked smart homes. A SoS offers functions to users that cannot be provided by its individual parts, but emerge as a combination of these. However, providing these functions with a required level of quality is difficult due to inherent uncertainties, such as systems that attach and detach at will and faults that are difficult to predict. Self-adaptation is a well-studied approach that enables a system to reason about itself and adapt to achieve particular quality objectives in the face of uncertainties and change. However, the inherently decentralized nature of SoS raises fundamental challenges to self-adaptation. This paper presents three architectural styles to realize self-adaptation in SoS, discusses key challenges for each style, and outlines starting points that could help to tackle these challenges.},

  volume = {2},
  issn = {1876-1364},
  abstract = {In a society where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) becomes a key component to improve the quality of our daily-life, systems' complexity dramatically increases to better accommodate to an inherent complexity of users' requirements, especially when dealing with pervasive computing. This poses demanding architectural requirements such as massive decentralization and disintermediation along with self-organizing properties. This higher level of system complexity has triggered the birth of several software engineering methodologies that adopt the agent paradigm. Design patterns are a well known approach for capturing and reusing knowledge related to known solution for recurrent architectural problems. Even though the importance of patterns is growing as systems become more and more complex, their development does not keep up with the evolving requirements, as traditional agent patterns are unable to support the majority of current complex social scenarios. This work motivates the need for new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible than traditional agent patterns such as, Broker and Matchmaker. The newly suggested structure supports the dynamic nature of ``Active Environment'' where groups of agents are formed for service delivery and then dissolved with no central coordinating mechanism\textemdash{}i.e., gaining the disintermediation property. Serving as a case study, the PEACH and PIL projects have paved the way for experimenting with the new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible and more suitable than traditional agent patterns for coping with ambient intelligence scenarios.},

In the uppermost layer, reactive plans are generated from goals expressed in a temporal logic. The middle layer is responsible for plan execution and assembling a configuration of domain-specific software components, which reside in the lowest layer. Moreover, the middle layer is responsible for selecting alternative components when the current configuration is no longer viable for the circumstances that have arisen.

The authors introduce a hierarchical agent-based system architecture, which enables self-organization and self-adaptation upon parallel embedded systems. Self-organization is achieved by dynamic clusterization, which groups self-aware components into a cluster and continuously updates the organization to account for application changes and internal errors. Self-adaptation is performed by hierarchical agents, based on the run-time organization, to monitor corresponding levels of components and reconfigure the system to improve energy efficiency and dependability. The system architecture achieves functional scalability via partitioning of agent intelligence, and physical scalability via level-specific software/hardware co-design of agents.},

  abstract = {Traditional software development is based on the closed-world assumption that the boundary between system and environment is known and unchanging. However, this assumption no longer works within today's unpredictable open-world settings, especially in ubiquitous and pervasive computing settings, which demand techniques that let software react to changes by self-organizing its structure and self-adapting its behavior. The more we move toward dynamic and heterogeneous systems, and the more we stress their self-healing and self-adapting capabilities, the more we need new approaches to develop these applications and new ways to structure and program them. Programming open systems requires new programming language features. Two features that bear investigation are introspection mechanisms to get runtime information about newly encountered services and reflective mechanisms to adapt client applications dynamically. Some existing standards, industrial products, and research prototypes that support, to a certain extent, the open-world assumptions are service-oriented technologies, publish/subscribe middleware systems, grid infrastructures, autonomic frameworks},

The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing current and planned computing systems, which require integrating several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing systems that extend into the Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body. These ideas are not science fiction, but elements of the grand challenge to create self-managing computing systems.},

Second, Tropos covers also the very early phases of requirements analysis, thus allowing for a deeper understanding of the environment where the software must operate, and of the kind of interactions that should occur between software and human agents. The methodology is illustrated with the help of a case study. The Tropos language for conceptual modeling is formalized in a metamodel described with a set of UML class diagrams.},

Most areas of computer science research, such as programming language implementation, distributed operating system design, or denotational semantics, are defined largely by technical problems, and driven by building upon and elaborating a body of past results. Ubiquitous computing, by contrast, encompasses a wide range of disparate technological areas brought together by a focus upon a common vision. It is driven, then, not so much by the problems of the past but by the possibilities of the future. Ubiquitous computing's vision, however, is over a decade old at this point, and we now inhabit the future imagined by its pioneers. The future, though, may not have worked out as the field collectively imagined. In this article, we explore the vision that has driven the ubiquitous computing research agenda and the contemporary practice that has emerged. Drawing on cross-cultural investigations of technology adoption, we argue for developing a ``ubicomp of the present'' which takes the messiness of everyday life as a central theme.},

Second, Tropos covers also the very early phases of requirements analysis, thus allowing for a deeper understanding of the environment where the software must operate, and of the kind of interactions that should occur between software and human agents.

This model, called requirements model, involves concepts that are currently not supported by existing formal specification languages, such as goals to be achieved, agents to be assigned, alternatives to be negotiated, etc. The paper presents an approach to requirements acquisition which is driven by such higher-level concepts. Requirements models are acquired as instances of a conceptual meta-model. The latter can be represented as a graph where each node captures an abstraction such as, e.g., goal, action, agent, entity, or event, and where the edges capture semantic links between such abstractions. Well-formedness properties on nodes and links constrain their instances\textemdash{}that is, elements of requirements models. Requirements acquisition processes then correspond to particular ways of traversing the meta-model graph to acquire appropriate instances of the various nodes and links according to such constraints. Acquisition processes are governed by strategies telling which way to follow systematically in that graph; at each node specific tactics can be used to acquire the corresponding instances. The paper describes a significant portion of the meta-model related to system goals, and one particular acquisition strategy where the meta-model is traversed backwards from such goals. The meta-model and the strategy are illustrated by excerpts of a university library system.},

In a changing world, modern software demands more and more adaptive features, many of them performed dynamically, and the requirements on the software architecture to support adaptation capabilities of systems are increasing in importance. Today, many embedded system families and application domains such as ecosystems, service-based applications, and self-adaptive systems demand runtime capabilities for flexible adaptation, reconfiguration, and post-deployment activities. However, as traditional software product line architectures fail to provide mechanisms for runtime adaptation and behavior of products, there is a shift toward designing more dynamic software architectures and building more adaptable software able to handle autonomous decision-making, according to varying conditions. Recent development approaches such as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) attempt to face the challenges of the dynamic conditions of such systems but the state of these solution architectures is still immature. In order to provide a more comprehensive treatment of DSPL models and their solution architectures, in this research work we provide an overview of the state of the art and current techniques that, partially, attempt to face the many challenges of runtime variability mechanisms in the context of Dynamic Software Product Lines. We also provide an integrated view of the challenges and solutions that are necessary to support runtime variability mechanisms in DSPL models and software architectures.},

The arguments in favor of goal orientation are first briefly discussed. The paper then com-pares the main approaches to goal modeling, goal specification and goal-based reasoning in the many activities of the requirements engineering process. To make the discussion more concrete, a real case study is used to suggest what a goal-oriented requirements engineering method may look like. Experience with such approaches and tool support are briefly discussed as well.},

With the current state-of-the-art software tools, these characteristics put a great burden on programmers who have to enable the applications to dynamically partition across multiple devices, and to adapt such partitioning to frequent context changes such as network failures. This paper explores service partitioning techniques for development of pervasive computing applications. We propose a resilient actor model to structurally add service partitioning property to the pervasive applications. The service partitioning realised using resilient actor model happens at runtime, is user guided and the resulting partitioned application is retractable, and resilient to network failures.},

  abstract = {Several agent-oriented software engineering methodologies address the emerging challenges posed by the increasing need of adaptive software. A common denominator of such methodologies is the paramount importance of the concept of goal model in order to understand the requirements of a software system. Goal models consist of goal graphs representing AND/OR-decomposition of abstract goals down to operationalisable leaf-level goals. Goal models are used primarily in the earlier phases of software engineering, for social modelling, requirements elicitation and analysis, to concretise abstract objectives, to detail them and to capture alternatives for their satisfaction. Although various agent programming languages incorporate the notion of (leaf-level) goal as a language construct, none of them natively support the definition of goal models. However, the semantic gap between goal models used at design-time and the concept of goal used at implementation and execution time represent a limitation especially in the development of self-adaptive and fault-tolerant systems. In such systems, design-time knowledge on goals and variability becomes relevant at run-time, to take autonomous decisions for achieving high level objectives correctly. Recently, unifying operational semantics for (leaf) goals have been proposed [15]. We extend this work to define an operational semantics for the behaviour of goals in goal models, maintaining the flexibility of using different goal types and conditions. We use a simple example to illustrate how the proposed approach effectively deals with the semantic gap between design-time goal models and run-time agent implementations.},

  abstract = {Deployment is a main development phase which configures a software to be ready for use in a certain environment. The ultimate goal of deployment is to enable users to achieve their requirements while using the deployed software. However, requirements are not uniform and differ between deployment environments. In one environment, certain requirements could be useless or redundant, thereby making some software functionalities superfluous. In another environment, instead, some requirements could be impossible to achieve and, thus, additional functionalities would be required. We advocate that ensuring fitness between requirements and the system environment is a basic and critical step to achieve a comprehensive deployment process. We propose a tool-supported modelling and analysis approach to tailor a requirements model to each environment in which the system is to be deployed. We study the case of a contextual goal model, which is a requirements model that captures the relationship between the variability of requirements (goal variability space) and the varying states of a deployment environment (context variability space). Our analysis relies on sampling a deployment environment to discover its context variability space and use it to identify loci in the contextual goal model where a modification has to take place. Finally, we apply our approach in practice and report on the obtained results.},

Although a number of approaches have been proposed, few address a key issue: that of distribution. In this paper we seek to overcome the limitations of centralised approaches. We build on our previous work on adaptive self-assembly within the three-layer model for autonomous systems to provide a decentralised technique for self-assembly. To achieve this in a fault-tolerant and scalable manner, we use a gossip protocol as a basis. While no central or leader node is aware of the full space of solutions, gossip ensures that agreement on a particular solution - in this case a component configuration - is reached in a logarithmic number of steps with respect to the size of the network.},

  abstract = {Goal models capture stakeholder requirements for a system-to-be, but also circumscribe a space of alternative specifications for fulfilling these requirements. Recent proposals for self-adaptive software systems rely on variants of goal models to support monitoring and adaptation functions. In such cases, goal models serve as mechanisms in terms of which systems reflect upon their requirements during their operation. We argue that existing proposals for using goal models at runtime are using design artifacts for purposes they were not intended, i.e., for reasoning about runtime system behavior. In this paper, we propose a conceptual distinction between Design-time Goal Models (DGMs)-used to design a system-and Runtime Goal Models (RGMs)-used to analyze a system's runtime behavior with respect to its requirements. RGMs extend DGMs with additional state, behavioral and historical information about the fulfillment of goals. We propose a syntactic structure for RGMs, a method for deriving them from DGMs, and runtime algorithms that support their monitoring.},

Understanding the situations where change has been planned for and recording the options possible within particular situations is usually not done explicitly. This becomes important if the architecture is used for many product versions over a long period or in a product line context where the architecture is used to build a variety of different products. That is, it is important to explicitly represent variation and indicate within the architecture locations for which change has been allowed.
We will describe how the management of variations in an architecture can be made more explicit and how the use of variation points connected to the choices a customer has when ordering a product can help to navigate to the appropriate places in the architecture.},

In particular, they need to be flexible in order to cope with dynamism in different forms (e.g. service and data providers and consumers). The current trend to build applications out of remote services makes the availability of constituent application components inherently dynamic. Developers can no longer assume that applications are static after development or at run time. Unfortunately, developing applications that are able to cope with dynamism is very complex. Existing development approaches do not provide explicit support for managing dynamism. In this paper we describe Rondo, a tool suite for designing pervasive applications. More specifically, we present our propositions in pervasive application specification, which borrows concepts from service-oriented component assembly, model-driven engineering (MDE) and continuous deployment, resulting in a more flexible approach than traditional application definitions. Then the capabilities of our application model are demonstrated with an example application scenario designed using our approach.},

  title = {Improving the {{Performance}}, {{Availability}}, and {{Security}} of {{Data Access}} for {{Opportunistic Mobile Computing}}},
  abstract = {An opportunistic model of mobile computing is presently emerging in which users can fully benefit from their personal computing environment wherever they are without having to carry "heavy-weight" mobile systems with them. The transition to this model can be seen as part of the pervasive computing vision, being catalyzed by the near ubiquity of powerful smart phones, the increasing availability of local PC hardware, and recent trends in virtualization and cloud computing. The fate of the opportunistic mobile computing model will be essentially decided by the performance, availability, and security of data access relative to alternative solutions. Mobile users require safe and efficient access to their data from whatever PC or device they are currently using, wherever they may be. These requirements expose several new challenges to the performance, availability, and security of user data access under opportunistic mobile computing conditions.In this dissertation, we identify challenges to user data access within the opportunistic mobile computing model, present novel approaches to address them, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches through extensive experimentation. To improve the performance of data access for opportunistic mobile computing, we introduce the concept of safe borrowing of local storage, which we prototyped as the TransPart system. To improve the availability of data access for opportunistic mobile computing, we introduce the concept of a self-cleaning portable cache, which we prototyped as the Horatio system. To improve the security of remote data access for opportunistic mobile computing, we introduce the Working Set-Based Access Control (WSBAC) scheme, which applies the concept of the working set to distributed file system access control.The main conclusion of our research is that opportunistic mobile computing can be realized in a safe and efficient manner for mobile users. Given the ad-hoc nature of opportunistic mobile computing, it is likely that the challenges identified in this dissertation will continue to exist into the foreseeable future. Fortunately, as our research shows, they can be addressed using nascent technologies and applying our concepts without violating the basic tenet of opportunistic mobile computing, namely to minimize the burden of what hardware users must carry.},

These devices will increasingly be networked, thus enabling the construction of distributed applications that have to adapt to changes in context, such as variations in network bandwidth, battery power, connectivity, reachability of services and hosts, etc. In this paper, we describe CARISMA, a mobile computing middleware which exploits the principle of reflection to enhance the construction of adaptive and context-aware mobile applications. The middleware provides software engineers with primitives to describe how context changes should be handled using policies. These policies may conflict. We classify the different types of conflicts that may arise in mobile computing and argue that conflicts cannot be resolved statically at the time applications are designed, but, rather, need to be resolved at execution time. We demonstrate a method by which policy conflicts can be handled; this method uses a microeconomic approach that relies on a particular type of sealed-bid auction. We describe how this method is implemented in the CARISMA middleware architecture and sketch a distributed context-aware application for mobile devices to illustrate how the method works in practice. We show, by way of a systematic performance evaluation, that conflict resolution does not imply undue overheads, before comparing our research to related work and concluding the paper.},

  abstract = {Modern applications, e.g., for pervasive computing scenarios, are increasingly reliant on systems built from multiple distributed components, which must be suitably composed to meet some specified functional and non-functional requirements. A key challenge is how to efficiently and effectively manage such complex systems. The use of self-management capabilities has been suggested as a possible way to address this challenge. To cope with the scalability and robustness issues of large distributed systems, self-management should ideally be architected in a decentralised way, where the overall system behaviour emerges from local decisions and interactions. Within this context, we propose GOPRIME, a fully decentralised middleware solution for the adaptive self-assembly of distributed services. The GOPRIME goal is to build and maintain an assembly of services that, besides functional requirements, fulfills also global quality-of-service and structural requirements. The key aspect of GOPRIME is the use of a gossip protocol to achieve decentralised information dissemination and decision making. To show the validity of our approach, we present results from the experimentation of a prototype implementation of GOPRIME in a mobile health application, and an extensive set of simulation experiments that assess the effectiveness of GOPRIME in terms of scalability, robustness and convergence speed.},

  abstract = {Mobile platforms are becoming the predominant medium of access to Internet services due to the tremendous increase in their computation and communication capabilities. However, enabling applications that require real-time in-the-field data collection and processing using mobile platforms is still challenging due to i) the insufficient computing capabilities and unavailability of complete data on individual mobile devices and ii) the prohibitive communication cost and response time involved in offloading data to remote computing resources such as cloud datacenters for centralized computation. A novel resource provisioning framework for organizing the heterogeneous sensing, computing, and communication capabilities of static and mobile devices in the vicinity in order to form an elastic resource pool-a hybrid static/mobile computing grid (also called a loosely-coupled mobile device cloud)-is presented. This local computing grid can be harnessed to enable innovative data-and compute-intensive mobile applications such as ubiquitous context-aware health and wellness monitoring of the elderly, distributed rainfall and flood-risk estimation, distributed object recognition and tracking, and content-based distributed multimedia search and sharing. In orderto address challenges such as the inherent uncertainty in the hybrid grid (in terms of network connectivity and device availability), the proposed role-based resource provisioning framework is imparted with autonomic capabilities, namely, self-organization, self-optimization, and self-healing. A thorough experimental analysis aimed at verifying and demonstrating the benefits brought by autonomic capabilities of the framework is also presented in detail.},

  abstract = {Runtime adaptation mechanisms that leverage software models extend the applicability of model-driven engineering techniques to the runtime environment. Contemporary mission-critical software systems are often expected to safely adapt to changes in their execution environment. Given the critical roles these systems play, it is often inconvenient to take them offline to adapt their functionality. Consequently, these systems are required, when feasible, to adapt their behavior at runtime with little or no human intervention. A promising approach to managing complexity in runtime environments is to develop adaptation mechanisms that leverage software models, referred to as models@run. time. Work on models@run.time seeks to extend the applicability of models produced in model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches to the runtime environment. Models@run. time is a causally connected self-representation of the associated system that emphasizes the structure, behavior, or goals of the system from a problem space perspective.},

  abstract = {Through the analysis of the different iterations of the Geometry Mobile (GEM) project, a mobile learning effort in the field of mathematics, we have identified a major architectural issue to be addressed in the design and implementation of m-learning applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the field many challenging requirements are continuously emerging. One of them relates to the possibility to support collaborative activities that demand sharing resources between students and their mobile devices in constantly changing conditions. These situations generate the need of using decentralized distributed architectures in which mobile devices can share resources to carry out the activity covering the concerns defined by the different stakeholders. This paper describes our current efforts connected to identifying a set of requirements for M-Learning activities. Thereafter, we elaborate on why a decentralized distributed system (DDS) can be used to provide a novel solution to tackle the mentioned above problems. Moreover, initial aspects related to the design of a DDS, including a self-adaptation mechanism are presented.},

Applications targeting such environments require adaptability and context-sensitivity to uncertain availability and failures in resources and their ad-hoc networks. Such heterogeneity is often hard to predict, making the deployment process a challenging task. Objective This paper proposes GoalD as a goal-driven framework to support autonomous deployment of heterogeneous computational resources to fulfill requirements, seen as goals, and their correlated components on one hand, and the variability space of the hosting computing and sensing environment on the other hand. Method GoalD comprises an offline and an online stage to fulfill autonomous deployment by leveraging the use of goals. Deployment configuration strategies arise from the variability structure of the Contextual Goal Model as an underlying structure to guide autonomous planning by selecting available as well as suitable resources at runtime. Results We evaluate GoalD on an existing exemplar from the self-adaptive systems community \textendash{} the Tele Assistance Service provided by Weyns and Calinescu [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate the scalability of GoalD on a repository consisting of 430,500 artifacts. The evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of GoalD in planning the deployment of a system with thousands of components in a few milliseconds.

  abstract = {An architectural approach to self-adaptive systems involves runtime change of system configuration (i.e., the system's components, their bindings and operational parameters) and behaviour update (i.e., component orchestration). The architecture should allow for both configuration and behaviour changes selected from pre-computed change strategies and for synthesised change strategies at run-time to satisfy changes in the environment, changes in the specified goals of the system or in response to failures or degradation in quality attributes, such as performance, of the system itself. Although controlling configuration and behaviour at runtime has been discussed and applied to architectural adaptation, architectures for self-adaptive systems often compound these two aspects reducing the potential for adaptability. In this work we provide an extended description of our proposal for a reference architecture that allows for coordinated yet transparent and independent adaptation of system configuration and behaviour.},

  abstract = {Context: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the de facto standard for business process modeling. It was developed by the Object Management Group with support of the major organizations in the fields of software engineering and information systems. Despite its wide use, when it comes to representing ubiquitous business processes, this business process modeling language is lacking. Objective: To address BPMN's deficiency in representing ubiquitous business processes, we extend it and present uBPMN (or ubiquitous BPMN). Method: First, we analyze the modeling requirements for representing ubiquitous business processes. Based on the requirements, we conservatively extend the Meta-Object Facility meta-model and the XML Schema Definition of BPMN as well as extend the notation. The extension, that we call uBPMN follows the same outline as set by the Object Management Group for BPMN. Results: The proposed uBPMN not only allows for modeling ubiquitous business processes but also lays the groundwork for potentially deploying a variety of ubiquitous computing technologies. We illustrate all of uBPMN's capabilities and benefits with real-life examples. Conclusion: uBPMN extends BPMN v2.0 with new capabilities to deal with ubiquitous computing technologies.},

The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing current and planned computing systems, which require integrating several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing systems that extend into the Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body. These ideas are not science fiction, but elements of the grand challenge to create self-managing computing systems.},

Goal-oriented requirements engineering is concerned with the use of goals for eliciting, elaborating, structuring, specifying, analyzing, negotiating, documenting, and modifying requirements. This area has received increasing attention over the past few years. The paper reviews various research efforts undertaken along this line of research. The arguments in favor of goal orientation are first briefly discussed. The paper then com-pares the main approaches to goal modeling, goal specification and goal-based reasoning in the many activities of the requirements engineering process. To make the discussion more concrete, a real case study is used to suggest what a goal-oriented requirements engineering method may look like. Experience with such approaches and tool support are briefly discussed as well.},

In particular, they need to be flexible in order to cope with dynamism in different forms (e.g. service and data providers and consumers). The current trend to build applications out of remote services makes the availability of constituent application components inherently dynamic. Developers can no longer assume that applications are static after development or at run time. Unfortunately, developing applications that are able to cope with dynamism is very complex. Existing development approaches do not provide explicit support for managing dynamism. In this paper we describe Rondo, a tool suite for designing pervasive applications. More specifically, we present our propositions in pervasive application specification, which borrows concepts from service-oriented component assembly, model-driven engineering (MDE) and continuous deployment, resulting in a more flexible approach than traditional application definitions. Then the capabilities of our application model are demonstrated with an example application scenario designed using our approach.},

In a changing world, modern software demands more and more adaptive features, many of them performed dynamically, and the requirements on the software architecture to support adaptation capabilities of systems are increasing in importance. Today, many embedded system families and application domains such as ecosystems, service-based applications, and self-adaptive systems demand runtime capabilities for flexible adaptation, reconfiguration, and post-deployment activities. However, as traditional software product line architectures fail to provide mechanisms for runtime adaptation and behavior of products, there is a shift toward designing more dynamic software architectures and building more adaptable software able to handle autonomous decision-making, according to varying conditions. Recent development approaches such as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) attempt to face the challenges of the dynamic conditions of such systems but the state of these solution architectures is still immature. In order to provide a more comprehensive treatment of DSPL models and their solution architectures, in this research work we provide an overview of the state of the art and current techniques that, partially, attempt to face the many challenges of runtime variability mechanisms in the context of Dynamic Software Product Lines. We also provide an integrated view of the challenges and solutions that are necessary to support runtime variability mechanisms in DSPL models and software architectures.},

One of them relates to the possibility to support collaborative activities that demand sharing resources between students and their mobile devices in constantly changing conditions. These situations generate the need of using decentralized distributed architectures in which mobile devices can share resources to carry out the activity covering the concerns defined by the different stakeholders. This paper describes our current efforts connected to identifying a set of requirements for M-Learning activities. Thereafter, we elaborate on why a decentralized distributed system (DDS) can be used to provide a novel solution to tackle the mentioned above problems.

  abstract = {Requirements analysis includes a preliminary acquisition step where a global model for the specification of the system and its environment is elaborated. This model, called requirements model, involves concepts that are currently not supported by existing formal specification languages, such as goals to be achieved, agents to be assigned, alternatives to be negotiated, etc. The paper presents an approach to requirements acquisition which is driven by such higher-level concepts. Requirements models are acquired as instances of a conceptual meta-model. The latter can be represented as a graph where each node captures an abstraction such as, e.g., goal, action, agent, entity, or event, and where the edges capture semantic links between such abstractions. Well-formedness properties on nodes and links constrain their instances\textemdash{}that is, elements of requirements models. Requirements acquisition processes then correspond to particular ways of traversing the meta-model graph to acquire appropriate instances of the various nodes and links according to such constraints. Acquisition processes are governed by strategies telling which way to follow systematically in that graph; at each node specific tactics can be used to acquire the corresponding instances. The paper describes a significant portion of the meta-model related to system goals, and one particular acquisition strategy where the meta-model is traversed backwards from such goals. The meta-model and the strategy are illustrated by excerpts of a university library system.},

  abstract = {Mobile platforms are becoming the predominant medium of access to Internet services due to the tremendous increase in their computation and communication capabilities. However, enabling applications that require real-time in-the-field data collection and processing using mobile platforms is still challenging due to i) the insufficient computing capabilities and unavailability of complete data on individual mobile devices and ii) the prohibitive communication cost and response time involved in offloading data to remote computing resources such as cloud datacenters for centralized computation. A novel resource provisioning framework for organizing the heterogeneous sensing, computing, and communication capabilities of static and mobile devices in the vicinity in order to form an elastic resource pool-a hybrid static/mobile computing grid (also called a loosely-coupled mobile device cloud)-is presented. This local computing grid can be harnessed to enable innovative data-and compute-intensive mobile applications such as ubiquitous context-aware health and wellness monitoring of the elderly, distributed rainfall and flood-risk estimation, distributed object recognition and tracking, and content-based distributed multimedia search and sharing. In orderto address challenges such as the inherent uncertainty in the hybrid grid (in terms of network connectivity and device availability), the proposed role-based resource provisioning framework is imparted with autonomic capabilities, namely, self-organization, self-optimization, and self-healing. A thorough experimental analysis aimed at verifying and demonstrating the benefits brought by autonomic capabilities of the framework is also presented in detail.},

  abstract = {Modern applications, e.g., for pervasive computing scenarios, are increasingly reliant on systems built from multiple distributed components, which must be suitably composed to meet some specified functional and non-functional requirements. A key challenge is how to efficiently and effectively manage such complex systems. The use of self-management capabilities has been suggested as a possible way to address this challenge. To cope with the scalability and robustness issues of large distributed systems, self-management should ideally be architected in a decentralised way, where the overall system behaviour emerges from local decisions and interactions. Within this context, we propose GOPRIME, a fully decentralised middleware solution for the adaptive self-assembly of distributed services. The GOPRIME goal is to build and maintain an assembly of services that, besides functional requirements, fulfills also global quality-of-service and structural requirements. The key aspect of GOPRIME is the use of a gossip protocol to achieve decentralised information dissemination and decision making. To show the validity of our approach, we present results from the experimentation of a prototype implementation of GOPRIME in a mobile health application, and an extensive set of simulation experiments that assess the effectiveness of GOPRIME in terms of scalability, robustness and convergence speed.},

  abstract = {In a society where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) becomes a key component to improve the quality of our daily-life, systems' complexity dramatically increases to better accommodate to an inherent complexity of users' requirements, especially when dealing with pervasive computing. This poses demanding architectural requirements such as massive decentralization and disintermediation along with self-organizing properties. This higher level of system complexity has triggered the birth of several software engineering methodologies that adopt the agent paradigm. Design patterns are a well known approach for capturing and reusing knowledge related to known solution for recurrent architectural problems. Even though the importance of patterns is growing as systems become more and more complex, their development does not keep up with the evolving requirements, as traditional agent patterns are unable to support the majority of current complex social scenarios. This work motivates the need for new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible than traditional agent patterns such as, Broker and Matchmaker. The newly suggested structure supports the dynamic nature of ``Active Environment'' where groups of agents are formed for service delivery and then dissolved with no central coordinating mechanism\textemdash{}i.e., gaining the disintermediation property. Serving as a case study, the PEACH and PIL projects have paved the way for experimenting with the new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible and more suitable than traditional agent patterns for coping with ambient intelligence scenarios.},

By adopting an architecture-based approach, it provides reusable infrastructure together with mechanisms for specializing that infrastructure to the needs of specific systems.

  abstract = {Mobile devices, such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, have gained wide-spread popularity. These devices will increasingly be networked, thus enabling the construction of distributed applications that have to adapt to changes in context, such as variations in network bandwidth, battery power, connectivity, reachability of services and hosts, etc. In this paper, we describe CARISMA, a mobile computing middleware which exploits the principle of reflection to enhance the construction of adaptive and context-aware mobile applications. The middleware provides software engineers with primitives to describe how context changes should be handled using policies. These policies may conflict. We classify the different types of conflicts that may arise in mobile computing and argue that conflicts cannot be resolved statically at the time applications are designed, but, rather, need to be resolved at execution time. We demonstrate a method by which policy conflicts can be handled; this method uses a microeconomic approach that relies on a particular type of sealed-bid auction. We describe how this method is implemented in the CARISMA middleware architecture and sketch a distributed context-aware application for mobile devices to illustrate how the method works in practice. We show, by way of a systematic performance evaluation, that conflict resolution does not imply undue overheads, before comparing our research to related work and concluding the paper.},

Recent proposals for self-adaptive software systems rely on variants of goal models to support monitoring and adaptation functions. In such cases, goal models serve as mechanisms in terms of which systems reflect upon their requirements during their operation. We argue that existing proposals for using goal models at runtime are using design artifacts for purposes they were not intended, i.e., for reasoning about runtime system behavior. In this paper, we propose a conceptual distinction between Design-time Goal Models (DGMs)-used to design a system-and Runtime Goal Models (RGMs)-used to analyze a system's runtime behavior with respect to its requirements. RGMs extend DGMs with additional state, behavioral and historical information about the fulfillment of goals. We propose a syntactic structure for RGMs, a method for deriving them from DGMs, and runtime algorithms that support their monitoring.},

  title = {Improving the {{Performance}}, {{Availability}}, and {{Security}} of {{Data}} {{Access}} for {{Opportunistic}} {{Mobile}} {{Computing}}},
  abstract = {An opportunistic model of mobile computing is presently emerging in which users can fully benefit from their personal computing environment wherever they are without having to carry "heavy-weight" mobile systems with them. The transition to this model can be seen as part of the pervasive computing vision, being catalyzed by the near ubiquity of powerful smart phones, the increasing availability of local PC hardware, and recent trends in virtualization and cloud computing. The fate of the opportunistic mobile computing model will be essentially decided by the performance, availability, and security of data access relative to alternative solutions. Mobile users require safe and efficient access to their data from whatever PC or device they are currently using, wherever they may be. These requirements expose several new challenges to the performance, availability, and security of user data access under opportunistic mobile computing conditions.In this dissertation, we identify challenges to user data access within the opportunistic mobile computing model, present novel approaches to address them, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches through extensive experimentation. To improve the performance of data access for opportunistic mobile computing, we introduce the concept of safe borrowing of local storage, which we prototyped as the TransPart system. To improve the availability of data access for opportunistic mobile computing, we introduce the concept of a self-cleaning portable cache, which we prototyped as the Horatio system. To improve the security of remote data access for opportunistic mobile computing, we introduce the Working Set-Based Access Control (WSBAC) scheme, which applies the concept of the working set to distributed file system access control.The main conclusion of our research is that opportunistic mobile computing can be realized in a safe and efficient manner for mobile users. Given the ad-hoc nature of opportunistic mobile computing, it is likely that the challenges identified in this dissertation will continue to exist into the foreseeable future. Fortunately, as our research shows, they can be addressed using nascent technologies and applying our concepts without violating the basic tenet of opportunistic mobile computing, namely to minimize the burden of what hardware users must carry.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing allows business users to scale up or down resource needs according to current demands (utility computing). Infrastructures for cloud computing can be distinguished with respect to the layer they operate on. In case of platform as a service (PAAS) frameworks are provided in order to simplify the construction of cloud applications relying on common base abstractions and tool sets. The focus of current PAAS frameworks is quite narrow and directed towards support for web applications and also visual tools for non-programmers. We envision that cloud computing can also substantially push forward typical enterprise applications if these applications are made to exploit cloud capabilities. In this paper we present an infrastructure for developing, deploying and managing distributed applications with the vision of distribution transparency in mind. The infrastructure is meant to be on PAAS layer but addresses developers instead of end users. It is founded on the active component paradigm for distributed applications, which allows applications being composed of agent-like autonomous entities interacting via services. The model facilitates building scalable and robust enterprise applications due to the high modularity and independently acting modules that can be replaced or restarted if unexpected errors occur. In addition to the infrastructure, a real world scenario of a distributed workflow management systems will be explained.},

As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the research community.

Most areas of computer science research, such as programming language implementation, distributed operating system design, or denotational semantics, are defined largely by technical problems, and driven by building upon and elaborating a body of past results. Ubiquitous computing, by contrast, encompasses a wide range of disparate technological areas brought together by a focus upon a common vision. It is driven, then, not so much by the problems of the past but by the possibilities of the future. Ubiquitous computing's vision, however, is over a decade old at this point, and we now inhabit the future imagined by its pioneers. The future, though, may not have worked out as the field collectively imagined. In this article, we explore the vision that has driven the ubiquitous computing research agenda and the contemporary practice that has emerged. Drawing on cross-cultural investigations of technology adoption, we argue for developing a ``ubicomp of the present'' which takes the messiness of everyday life as a central theme.},

  isbn = {978-0-9817381-6-1},
  abstract = {Several agent-oriented software engineering methodologies address the emerging challenges posed by the increasing need of adaptive software. A common denominator of such methodologies is the paramount importance of the concept of goal model in order to understand the requirements of a software system. Goal models consist of goal graphs representing AND/OR-decomposition of abstract goals down to operationalisable leaf-level goals. Goal models are used primarily in the earlier phases of software engineering, for social modelling, requirements elicitation and analysis, to concretise abstract objectives, to detail them and to capture alternatives for their satisfaction. Although various agent programming languages incorporate the notion of (leaf-level) goal as a language construct, none of them natively support the definition of goal models. However, the semantic gap between goal models used at design-time and the concept of goal used at implementation and execution time represent a limitation especially in the development of self-adaptive and fault-tolerant systems. In such systems, design-time knowledge on goals and variability becomes relevant at run-time, to take autonomous decisions for achieving high level objectives correctly. Recently, unifying operational semantics for (leaf) goals have been proposed [15]. We extend this work to define an operational semantics for the behaviour of goals in goal models, maintaining the flexibility of using different goal types and conditions. We use a simple example to illustrate how the proposed approach effectively deals with the semantic gap between design-time goal models and run-time agent implementations.},

This assumption is no longer valid in emerging computing paradigms, such as ambient, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, where it is essential to monitor and adapt to an inherently varying context. Besides influencing the software, context may influence stakeholders' goals and their choices to meet them. In this paper, we propose a goal-oriented RE modeling and reasoning framework for systems operating in varying contexts. We introduce contextual goal models to relate goals and contexts; context analysis to refine contexts and identify ways to verify them; reasoning techniques to derive requirements reflecting the context and users priorities at runtime; and finally, design time reasoning techniques to derive requirements for a system to be developed at minimum cost and valid in all considered contexts. We illustrate and evaluate our approach through a case study about a museum-guide mobile information system.},

Contemporary mission-critical software systems are often expected to safely adapt to changes in their execution environment. Given the critical roles these systems play, it is often inconvenient to take them offline to adapt their functionality. Consequently, these systems are required, when feasible, to adapt their behavior at runtime with little or no human intervention. A promising approach to managing complexity in runtime environments is to develop adaptation mechanisms that leverage software models, referred to as models@run. time. Work on models@run.time seeks to extend the applicability of models produced in model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches to the runtime environment. Models@run. time is a causally connected self-representation of the associated system that emphasizes the structure, behavior, or goals of the system from a problem space perspective.},

  abstract = {Deployment is a main development phase which configures a software to be ready for use in a certain environment. The ultimate goal of deployment is to enable users to achieve their requirements while using the deployed software. However, requirements are not uniform and differ between deployment environments. In one environment, certain requirements could be useless or redundant, thereby making some software functionalities superfluous. In another environment, instead, some requirements could be impossible to achieve and, thus, additional functionalities would be required. We advocate that ensuring fitness between requirements and the system environment is a basic and critical step to achieve a comprehensive deployment process. We propose a tool-supported modelling and analysis approach to tailor a requirements model to each environment in which the system is to be deployed. We study the case of a contextual goal model, which is a requirements model that captures the relationship between the variability of requirements (goal variability space) and the varying states of a deployment environment (context variability space). Our analysis relies on sampling a deployment environment to discover its context variability space and use it to identify loci in the contextual goal model where a modification has to take place. Finally, we apply our approach in practice and report on the obtained results.},

Instead, there is an increasing need for automation tools that continuously deploy software into execution, in order to push updates or adapt existing software regarding contextual and business changes. Existing solutions fall short on providing fault-tolerant, reproducible deployments that can scale on heterogeneous environments. In this paper we present Rondo, a tool suite that enables continuous deployment for dynamic, service-oriented applications. At the center of these tools, we propose a deterministic and idem potent deployment process. We provide with Rondo a deployment manager that implements this process and capable of conducting deployments and continuously adapting applications according to the changes in the current target platform. The tool suite also includes a domain-specific language for describing deployment requests. We validate our approach in multiple projects, for provisioning the platform as well as for installing applications and continuous reconfigurations.},

Scholarly dissemination and communication standards are changing to reflect the increasingly computational nature of scholarly research, primarily to include the sharing of the data and code associated with published results. We also present these Best Practices as a living, evolving, and changing document at http://wiki.stodden.net/Best\_Practices.},

  title = {A Deployment System for Pervasive Computing},
  abstract = {Software has for a long time been used for controlling different systems. Today, there is a trend towards integrating more software in consumer electronics, home appliances, cars etc. Suddenly software is moving from traditional environments, such as the desktop computer into new and unknown territory. This will influence many aspects of the software engineering process; above all, several new problems have arisen in the domain of software deployment. How can software be effectively deployed in these environments? Current deployment strategies are not directly applicable. The paper discusses problems with current deployment models and proposes a new, modified model. A deployment model for pervasive computing must support component based development, different delivery models, and installation and activation strategies. Support for dynamic installation and activation (i.e. making modifications without de-activating the software), is especially important. We introduce a prototype implementation, the Java Distributed Run-time Updating Management System (JDRUMS), which we have used as a vehicle for eliciting requirements for our deployment model},

  abstract = {Domotics, concerned with the realization of intelligent home environments, is a novel field which can highly benefit from solutions inspired by service-oriented principles to enhance the convenience and security of modern home residents. In this work, we present an architecture for a smart home, starting from the lower device interconnectivity level up to the higher application layers that undertake the load of complex functionalities and provide a number of services to end-users. We claim that in order for smart homes to exhibit a genuinely intelligent behavior, the ability to compute compositions of individual devices automatically and dynamically is paramount. To this end, we incorporate into the architecture a composition component that employs artificial intelligence domain-independent planning to generate compositions at runtime, in a constantly evolving environment. We have implemented a fully working prototype that realizes such an architecture, and have evaluated it both in terms of performance as well as from the end-user point of view. The results of the evaluation show that the service-oriented architectural design and the support for dynamic compositions is quite efficient from the technical point of view, and that the system succeeds in satisfying the expectations and objectives of the users.},

  title = {{{GODA}}: {{A}} Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering Framework for Runtime Dependability Analysis},
  volume = {80},
  issn = {0950-5849},
  abstract = {Abstract Context: Many modern software systems must deal with changes and uncertainty. Traditional dependability requirements engineering is not equipped for this since it assumes that the context in which a system operates be stable and deterministic, which often leads to failures and recurrent corrective maintenance. The Contextual Goal Model (CGM), a requirements model that proposes the idea of context-dependent goal fulfillment, mitigates the problem by relating alternative strategies for achieving goals to the space of context changes. Additionally, the Runtime Goal Model (RGM) adds behavioral constraints to the fulfillment of goals that may be checked against system execution traces. Objective: This paper proposes \{GODA\} (Goal-Oriented Dependability Analysis) and its supporting framework as concrete means for reasoning about the dependability requirements of systems that operate in dynamic contexts. Method: \{GODA\} blends the power of CGM, \{RGM\} and probabilistic model checking to provide a formal requirements specification and verification solution. At design time, it can help with design and implementation decisions; at runtime it helps the system self-adapt by analyzing the different alternatives and selecting the one with the highest probability for the system to be dependable. \{GODA\} is integrated into TAO4ME, a state-of-the-art tool for goal modeling and analysis. Results: \{GODA\} has been evaluated against feasibility and scalability on Mobee: a real-life software system that allows people to share live and updated information about public transportation via mobile devices, and on larger goal models. \{GODA\} can verify, at runtime, up to two thousand leaf-tasks in less than 35ms, and requires less than 240 KB of memory. Conclusion: Presented results show GODA's design-time and runtime verification capabilities, even under limited computational resources, and the scalability of the proposed solution.},

The increasing demand for complex networked software, which makes computing resources available to anyone, anywhere and at any time, is drawing attention to the engineering of self-adaptive software. The objective of our work is to define a process and a tool-supported design framework to develop self-adaptive systems, which consider Belief-Desire-Intention agent models as reference architectures. We adopt an agent-oriented approach, which allows to explicitly model system goals in requirements specification and in the system architecture design. Moreover, goal achievement conditions are specified along with their relationships with the environment and with possible failures, and corresponding recovery actions. This paper aims at motivating and giving an overview of our approach with the help of an example.},

There is growing demand for software systems able to self-reconfigure, and specifically systems that can fulfill their requirements in dynamic environments. We propose a conceptual architecture that provides systems with self-reconfiguration capabilities, enacting a model-based adaptation process based on requirements models. We describe the logical view on our architecture for self-reconfiguration, then we detail the main mechanisms to monitor for and diagnose failures. We present a case study where a self-reconfiguring system assists a patient perform daily tasks, such as getting breakfast, within her home. The challenge for the system is to fulfill its mission regardless of the context, also to compensate for failures caused by patient inaction or other omissions in the environment of the system.},

To operate reliably, such systems should be able to adapt to new circumstances on their own. This paper describes our combined approach for adaptable software architecture and task synthesis from high-level goals, which is based on a three-layer model. In the uppermost layer, reactive plans are generated from goals expressed in a temporal logic. The middle layer is responsible for plan execution and assembling a configuration of domain-specific software components, which reside in the lowest layer. Moreover, the middle layer is responsible for selecting alternative components when the current configuration is no longer viable for the circumstances that have arisen. The implementation demonstrates that the approach enables us to handle non-determinism in the environment and unexpected failures in software components.},

The reason for this is not least due to the advent of computing trends like ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, and cyber-physical systems, where systems are usually open for dynamic integration and able to react adaptively to changing situations. Despite being open and adaptive, it is a common requirement for such systems to be safe. However, traditional safety assurance techniques, both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art ones, are not sufficient in this context. We have recently developed some initial solution concepts based on conditional safety certificates and corresponding runtime analyses. In this article we show how to operationalize these concepts. To this end, we present in detail how to specify conditional safety certificates, how to transform them into suitable runtime models, and how these models finally support dynamic safety evaluations.},

However, this assumption no longer works within today's unpredictable open-world settings, especially in ubiquitous and pervasive computing settings, which demand techniques that let software react to changes by self-organizing its structure and self-adapting its behavior. The more we move toward dynamic and heterogeneous systems, and the more we stress their self-healing and self-adapting capabilities, the more we need new approaches to develop these applications and new ways to structure and program them. Programming open systems requires new programming language features. Two features that bear investigation are introspection mechanisms to get runtime information about newly encountered services and reflective mechanisms to adapt client applications dynamically. Some existing standards, industrial products, and research prototypes that support, to a certain extent, the open-world assumptions are service-oriented technologies, publish/subscribe middleware systems, grid infrastructures, autonomic frameworks},

Software architects normally plan for change and put mechanisms in the architecture to support those changes. Understanding the situations where change has been planned for and recording the options possible within particular situations is usually not done explicitly. This becomes important if the architecture is used for many product versions over a long period or in a product line context where the architecture is used to build a variety of different products. That is, it is important to explicitly represent variation and indicate within the architecture locations for which change has been allowed. We will describe how the management of variations in an architecture can be made more explicit and how the use of variation points connected to the choices a customer has when ordering a product can help to navigate to the appropriate places in the architecture.},

In particular, we focus on changes in the service provider landscape in order to plug in interchangeably components and services providing the functionalities defined by the component framework. The dynamic adaptations are operated automatically for optimizing the application utility in a given execution context.

The authors introduce a hierarchical agent-based system architecture, which enables self-organization and self-adaptation upon parallel embedded systems. Self-organization is achieved by dynamic clusterization, which groups self-aware components into a cluster and continuously updates the organization to account for application changes and internal errors. Self-adaptation is performed by hierarchical agents, based on the run-time organization, to monitor corresponding levels of components and reconfigure the system to improve energy efficiency and dependability. The system architecture achieves functional scalability via partitioning of agent intelligence, and physical scalability via level-specific software/hardware co-design of agents.},

  title = {A Framework for Constraint-Based Development and Autonomic Management of Distributed Applications},
  abstract = {We propose a framework for the deployment and subsequent autonomic management of component-based distributed applications. An initial deployment goal is specified using a declarative constraint language, expressing constraints over aspects such as component-host mappings and component interconnection topology. A constraint solver is used to find a configuration that satisfies the goal, and the configuration is deployed automatically. The deployed application is instrumented to allow subsequent autonomic management. If, during execution, the manager detects that the original goal is no longer being met, the satisfy/deploy process can be repeated automatically in order to generate a revised deployment that does meet the goal.},

  abstract = {Vemos um crescente interesse em aplica{\c c}{\~o}es que devem contar com ambientes de computa{\c c}{\~a}o heterog{\^e}neos, como a Internet das Coisas (IoT). Esses aplicativos s{\~a}o destinados a executar em uma ampla gama de dispositivos com diferentes recursos computacionais dispon{\'i}veis. Para lidar com algum tipo de heterogeneidade, como dois tipos poss{\'i}veis de processadores gr{\'a}ficos em um computador pessoal, podemos usar abordagens simples como um script que escolhe a biblioteca de software certa a ser copiada para uma pasta. Essas abordagens simples s{\~a}o centralizadas e criadas em tempo de design. Eles requerem um especialista ou equipe para controlar todo o espa{\c c}o de variabilidade. Dessa forma, essas abordagens n{\~a}o s{\~a}o escal{\'a}veis para ambientes altamente heterog{\^e}neos. Em ambientes altamente heterog{\^e}neos, {\'e} dif{\'i}cil prever o ambiente computacional em tempo de projeto, implicando provavelmente indecidibilidade na configura{\c c}{\~a}o correta para cada ambiente. Em nosso trabalho, propomos GoalD: um m{\'e}todo que permite a implanta{\c c}{\~a}o aut{\^o}noma de sistemas, refletindo sobre os objetivos do sistema e seu ambiente computacional. Por implanta{\c c}{\~a}o aut{\^o}noma, queremos dizer que o sistema {\'e} capaz de encontrar o conjunto correto de componentes para o ambiente computacional alvo, sem interven{\c c}{\~a}o humana. N{\'o}s avaliamos nossa abordagem em um estudo de caso: conselheiro de esta{\c c}{\~a}o de abastecimento, onde uma aplica{\c c}{\~a}o aconselha um motorista onde reabastecer / recarregar seu ve{\'i}culo. N{\'o}s projetamos a aplica{\c c}{\~a}o com variabilidade em n{\'i}vel de requisitos, arquitetura e implanta{\c c}{\~a}o, o que pode permitir que a aplica{\c c}{\~a}o projetada seja executada em diferentes dispositivos. Para cen{\'a}rios com diferentes ambientes, foi poss{\'i}vel planejar a implanta{\c c}{\~a}o de forma aut{\^o}noma. Al{\'e}m disso, a escalabilidade do algoritmo que planeja a implanta{\c c}{\~a}o foi avaliada em um ambiente simulado. Os resultados mostram que usando a abordagem {\'e} poss{\'i}vel planejar de forma aut{\^o}noma a implanta{\c c}{\~a}o de um sistema com milhares de componentes em poucos segundos.},

  abstract = {A self-adaptive software system modifies its behavior at runtime in response to changes within the system or in its execution environment. The fulfillment of the system requirements needs to be guaranteed even in the presence of adverse conditions and adaptations. Thus, a key challenge for self-adaptive software systems is assurance. Traditionally, confidence in the correctness of a system is gained through a variety of activities and processes performed at development time, such as design analysis and testing. In the presence of selfadaptation, however, some of the assurance tasks may need to be performed at runtime. This need calls for the development of techniques that enable continuous assurance throughout the software life cycle. Fundamental to the development of runtime assurance techniques is research into the use of models at runtime (M@RT). This chapter explores the state of the art for usingM@RT to address the assurance of self-adaptive software systems. It defines what information can be captured by M@RT, specifically for the purpose of assurance, and puts this definition into the context of existing work. We then outline key research challenges for assurance at runtime and characterize assurance methods. The chapter concludes with an exploration of selected application areas where M@RT could provide significant benefits beyond existing assurance techniques for adaptive systems.},

  isbn = {978-91-88761-05-7},
  abstract = {Modern software systems are increasingly characterized by uncertainties in the operating context and user requirements. These uncertainties are difficult to predict at design time. Achieving the quality goals of such systems depends on the ability of the software to deal with these uncertainties at runtime. A self-adaptive system employs a feedback loop to continuously monitor and adapt itself to achieve particular quality goals (i.e., adaptation goals) regardless of uncertainties. Current research applies formal techniques to provide guarantees for adaptation goals, typically using exhaustive verification techniques. Although these techniques offer strong guarantees for the goals, they suffer from well-known state explosion problem. In this thesis, we take a broader perspective and focus on two types of guarantees: (1) functional correctness of the feedback loop, and (2) guaranteeing the adaptation goals in an efficient manner. To that end, we present ActivFORMS (Active FORmal Models for Self-adaptation), a formally founded model-driven approach for engineering self-adaptive systems with guarantees. ActivFORMS achieves functional correctness by direct execution of formally verified models of the feedback loop using a reusable virtual machine. To efficiently provide guarantees for the adaptation goals with a required level of confidence, ActivFORMS applies statistical model checking at runtime. ActivFORMS supports on the fly changes of adaptation goals and updates of the verified feedback loop models that meet the changed goals. To demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the approach, we applied ActivFORMS in several domains: warehouse transportation, oceanic surveillance, tele assistance, and IoT building security monitoring.},

  abstract = {Traditional software development is based on the closed-world assumption that the boundary between system and environment is known and unchanging. However, this assumption no longer works within today's unpredictable open-world settings, especially in ubiquitous and pervasive computing settings, which demand techniques that let software react to changes by self-organizing its structure and self-adapting its behavior. The more we move toward dynamic and heterogeneous systems, and the more we stress their self-healing and self-adapting capabilities, the more we need new approaches to develop these applications and new ways to structure and program them. Programming open systems requires new programming language features. Two features that bear investigation are introspection mechanisms to get runtime information about newly encountered services and reflective mechanisms to adapt client applications dynamically. Some existing standards, industrial products, and research prototypes that support, to a certain extent, the open-world assumptions are service-oriented technologies, publish/subscribe middleware systems, grid infrastructures, autonomic frameworks},

The authors introduce a hierarchical agent-based system architecture, which enables self-organization and self-adaptation upon parallel embedded systems. Self-organization is achieved by dynamic clusterization, which groups self-aware components into a cluster and continuously updates the organization to account for application changes and internal errors. Self-adaptation is performed by hierarchical agents, based on the run-time organization, to monitor corresponding levels of components and reconfigure the system to improve energy efficiency and dependability. The system architecture achieves functional scalability via partitioning of agent intelligence, and physical scalability via level-specific software/hardware co-design of agents.},

The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing current and planned computing systems, which require integrating several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing systems that extend into the Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body. These ideas are not science fiction, but elements of the grand challenge to create self-managing computing systems.},

This dichotomy has motivated us to perform a comparative study between two proposals for the design of adaptive systems: the Rainbow Framework (architecture-based) and our own proposal, Zanshin (requirements-based). This evaluation paper reports on our methodology and results. It also provides a comparison between the use of architectural and requirements models as centrepieces of adaptation, offering guidelines for the future research in the field of adaptive systems.},

An initial deployment goal is specified using a declarative constraint language, expressing constraints over aspects such as component-host mappings and component interconnection topology. A constraint solver is used to find a configuration that satisfies the goal, and the configuration is deployed automatically. The deployed application is instrumented to allow subsequent autonomic management. If, during execution, the manager detects that the original goal is no longer being met, the satisfy/deploy process can be repeated automatically in order to generate a revised deployment that does meet the goal.},

  abstract = {In a society where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) becomes a key component to improve the quality of our daily-life, systems' complexity dramatically increases to better accommodate to an inherent complexity of users' requirements, especially when dealing with pervasive computing. This poses demanding architectural requirements such as massive decentralization and disintermediation along with self-organizing properties. This higher level of system complexity has triggered the birth of several software engineering methodologies that adopt the agent paradigm. Design patterns are a well known approach for capturing and reusing knowledge related to known solution for recurrent architectural problems. Even though the importance of patterns is growing as systems become more and more complex, their development does not keep up with the evolving requirements, as traditional agent patterns are unable to support the majority of current complex social scenarios. This work motivates the need for new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible than traditional agent patterns such as, Broker and Matchmaker. The newly suggested structure supports the dynamic nature of ``Active Environment'' where groups of agents are formed for service delivery and then dissolved with no central coordinating mechanism\textemdash{}i.e., gaining the disintermediation property. Serving as a case study, the PEACH and PIL projects have paved the way for experimenting with the new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible and more suitable than traditional agent patterns for coping with ambient intelligence scenarios.},

The increasing demand for complex networked software, which makes computing resources available to anyone, anywhere and at any time, is drawing attention to the engineering of self-adaptive software. The objective of our work is to define a process and a tool-supported design framework to develop self-adaptive systems, which consider Belief-Desire-Intention agent models as reference architectures. We adopt an agent-oriented approach, which allows to explicitly model system goals in requirements specification and in the system architecture design. Moreover, goal achievement conditions are specified along with their relationships with the environment and with possible failures, and corresponding recovery actions. This paper aims at motivating and giving an overview of our approach with the help of an example.},

The reason for this is not least due to the advent of computing trends like ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, and cyber-physical systems, where systems are usually open for dynamic integration and able to react adaptively to changing situations. Despite being open and adaptive, it is a common requirement for such systems to be safe. However, traditional safety assurance techniques, both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art ones, are not sufficient in this context. We have recently developed some initial solution concepts based on conditional safety certificates and corresponding runtime analyses. In this article we show how to operationalize these concepts. To this end, we present in detail how to specify conditional safety certificates, how to transform them into suitable runtime models, and how these models finally support dynamic safety evaluations.},

A SoS offers functions to users that cannot be provided by its individual parts, but emerge as a combination of these. However, providing these functions with a required level of quality is difficult due to inherent uncertainties, such as systems that attach and detach at will and faults that are difficult to predict. Self-adaptation is a well-studied approach that enables a system to reason about itself and adapt to achieve particular quality objectives in the face of uncertainties and change. However, the inherently decentralized nature of SoS raises fundamental challenges to self-adaptation. This paper presents three architectural styles to realize self-adaptation in SoS, discusses key challenges for each style, and outlines starting points that could help to tackle these challenges.},

  abstract = {Autonomous driving is a multi-agent setting where the host vehicle must apply sophisticated negotiation skills with other road users when overtaking, giving way, merging, taking left and right turns and while pushing ahead in unstructured urban roadways. Since there are many possible scenarios, manually tackling all possible cases will likely yield a too simplistic policy. Moreover, one must balance between unexpected behavior of other drivers/pedestrians and at the same time not to be too defensive so that normal traffic flow is maintained. In this paper we apply deep reinforcement learning to the problem of forming long term driving strategies. We note that there are two major challenges that make autonomous driving different from other robotic tasks. First, is the necessity for ensuring functional safety - something that machine learning has difficulty with given that performance is optimized at the level of an expectation over many instances. Second, the Markov Decision Process model often used in robotics is problematic in our case because of unpredictable behavior of other agents in this multi-agent scenario. We make three contributions in our work. First, we show how policy gradient iterations can be used without Markovian assumptions. Second, we decompose the problem into a composition of a Policy for Desires (which is to be learned) and trajectory planning with hard constraints (which is not learned). The goal of Desires is to enable comfort of driving, while hard constraints guarantees the safety of driving. Third, we introduce a hierarchical temporal abstraction we call an "Option Graph" with a gating mechanism that significantly reduces the effective horizon and thereby reducing the variance of the gradient estimation even further.},
